		<p> The Big Island of Hawaii’s green sand beach is located at the southern tip just west of South Point. The sand is actually a green olive color caused by eruptions from what was once a volcano. In fact, green sand beach itself is within what was once a cinder cone. Three sides of the cone are still present, with the ocean coming in from what would have been the eastern edge. Imagine swimming in an ancient volcano’s cinder cone with green sand? You can and it is a site not to be missed when traveling to the Big Island.</p>

		<p> Green Sand Beach is named Papakolea. The green sand gets it’s color from olivine crystals created from eruptions to a dormant volcano years ago. Nestled in Mahana Bay, this is truly a unique place and one of only two green sand beaches in the world. While there are no organized tours, this isolated place is about a 2 1/2 hour drive from most of the resorts up along the Kohola Coast.Keep in mind, driving to the actual beach is out for all but the most experienced off road drivers. Instead, most opt for a 2 1/2 mile hike each way along the wind swept and hot dusty deep rutted jeep roads.</p>
